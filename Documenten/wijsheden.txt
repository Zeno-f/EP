LAT vs PORT

The old R/W/M problem is caused by glitching and playing tug-of-war with the pin from the outside world. A port write can be fooled by the fact that the memory bit is actually tied to the hostile outside environment. The latch register was put as a buffered memory location to protect against this and drive the port pin, even when it is getting hammered from the outside world.
 
As Dario always reminds people "talk to the latch, not the port".
